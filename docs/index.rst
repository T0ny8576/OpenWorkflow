OpenWorkflow Documentation
###########################

OpenWorkflow is a suite of development tools to facilitate the creation and
implemention of `Wearable Cognitive Assistants (WCA)`_. They key idea of
OpenWorkflow is to represent WCA application logic as finite state machines (FSM). You
can read more about the fast prototyping methodology of OpenWorkflow in
`this document (Section 6.2) <https://junjuew.github.io/assets/thesis.pdf>`_.

OpenWorkflow provides the following tools.

* gabrieltool: A Python library to create and persist finite state machine based wearable cognitive assistants.
* Finite State Machine (FSM) Web Editor: A browser-based GUI to view and edit state machines.
