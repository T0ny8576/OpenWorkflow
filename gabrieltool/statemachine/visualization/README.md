# Visualization Tool for State Machines

The [index.html](index.html) webpage displays a state machine from file. The
state machine needs to be created and serialized using the
[statemachine](../statemachine) python package. To use, open the index.html from
a browser and select a state machine file. A sample state machine file can be
downloaded from [here](../../../examples/sandwich/sandwich.pbfsm).

The webpage is built using [jointjs](https://github.com/clientIO/joint) and
[protobuf js](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/js).
